How to play:
    Mancala is a two player strategy game. 
    
    There are 2 rows of 6 bowls with a "store" on each side.
    
    Each player takes turns picking a bowl and moving stones 
    counter clockwise, depositing one stone in each bowl until 
    all stones are gone. Stones put into your own store are 
    kept, and your opponents store is skipped.
    
    The player with the most stones in their store wins.

Modes:
    Capture: The classic way of playing mancala. 
            After you finish your move, if the final stone 
            lands on your side in an empty bowl take that 
            piece and the pices on the opposite side and
            put them in your own store.

            If the final stone lands in your store you get
            a free move.

            If one side is empty the game ends. If the other 
            side still has pieces that side captures them, and
            puts them in their store.
            
            The side with the most pieces wins. 
    
    Avalanche: A modified version of mancala.
            After you finish your move if the final piece lands
            in a bowl that is not empty move those pieces. 
            Repeat until the final piece lands in a store or an 
            empty bowl. 
            
            If it lands in a store you get a free move. If it 
            lands in an empty bowl end your turn.

            If one side is empty the game ends. 
            
            The side with the most pieces in their store at the 
            end wins.

Difficulty:
    Normal: Every bowl gets 4 stones.
    Random: Every bowl gets a random ammount of stones from 2-6.
